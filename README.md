# Caves-of-Qud-Mod---Container-Variations-For-Liquids
Caves of Qud mod, based on [Angry Static's "More Fluid Storage Containers"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1560168385), and then [Cantorsdust's "Unofficial More Fluid Storage Containers"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2105691877) mods, of the more container type of variety, mods.  This mod also color coordinates liquid type to the tiles detail color- alongside also color coding the names a bit.  Also, for every container, there is a different tile for when it is empty or when it is filled of some sort of liquid.

Have had to redo some stuff with the new Moon Stair beta.  The part 'PopulationLiquidFiller' is a nuke now if added to the ten dram phial, and ONLY the ten dram phial, but works fine with all the others..  So that's weird.
