# Caves-of-Qud-Mod---Caves-of-Quolor-&-Quontainers
Caves of Qud mod, based on [Angry Static's "More Fluid Storage Containers"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1560168385), and then [Cantorsdust's "Unofficial More Fluid Storage Containers"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2105691877) mods, of the more container type of variety, mods.  This mod also color coordinates liquid type to the tiles detail color- alongside also color coding the names a bit.  Also, for every container, there is a different tile for when it is empty or when it is filled of some sort of liquid.

Now also combined and tweaked with plutovi's ["Caves of Color"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2811969951) which was a "simple mod that adds a splash of color to normally statically-hued objects, and reveals a few normally hidden secondary colors of tiles.

Items with rainbow-randomized parts:
Walking sticks, crayon boxes, clay pots, gourds, staves, wide brimmed hats, teleprojectors, spectacles, beds, cribs, four-poster beds, floor cushions, stools, hookahs, breadboards, woven baskets, and cloth robes.

Items with randomization within a specific color palette:
Moon masks, sun and moon masks, wool kilts, rainboweave cloaks, chiral rings, scrapasans, globes, sewing machines, patchwork coats, scarlet shawls, quilted shawls, snapjaw scavenger capes, bookshelves, alchemist tables, equimaxes, woven baskets specified as preserved food rations, and salamanders.

Color-corrected items, and things with their secondary color now visible:
Worn burnooses, electrobows, iron gates, iron fences, boars, grandfather horns, goats, bears, barkbiters, mimics, rimewyks, mechanimist catechists, pigs, ghost perch, bloated pearlfrogs, amber-tipped staves, snapjaw shotgunners, cave spiders, desert krises, food cubes, and blood-stained neckrings.

Misc:
Stiltground tent signs, grenades, and barathrumites are uniquely colored. Kilndled flame has added flaming effects. Dragonfly wings flicker.

(This is baby's first mod, and very easily editable. Feel free to yoink any of this mods content for use in your own projects. Comments, criticism, and suggestions welcome via pms, comments, or through discord.)"

Finally, combined the best parts (subjective opinion) of Jak(i)'s ["JakTiles"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405138140) + ["JakTiles Legacy"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2779966394), alongside some new tiles I've made, in order to revamp a few characters to be more accurate to their description / depiction.

So now tweaks some stuff to basically combine the effect of empty/full tiles and colors to names and containers into a super mod.
